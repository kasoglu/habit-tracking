# Habit Tracking

A habit tracker program is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. 

# Installing
Download the [Python 3](https://python.org) installer package from the official website and install it, if not installed previously.

Run the following in the terminal to install the Requests module to get weather data from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/).
```
pip install requests
```


# How to Use?

Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.
```
python3 main.py
```
* Note! For the code to work you need to replace all the placeholders with your own details. e.g. ```USERNAME```, ```YOUR TOKEN```, ```GRAPH_ID```.

Once you replace the own details in the code, run the program.
